      <h2>Four steps towards finding a recruitment agency</h2>
    </div>
    <div class='grid_6'>
      <h4><span class='blue'>Step 1:</span>Decide what kind of job you want</h4>
      <p>Think about what you want from your next job. Do you want a permanent or temporary role? Do you want to work part-time or full-time, or as a contractor or freelancer?</p>
    </div>
    <div class='grid_6'>
      <h4><span class='blue'>Step 2:</span>Decide where you want to work</h4>
      <p>Consider what industry you want to work in and at what level. If you are only looking for senior management level jobs, it makes sense to approach recruitment consultants who specialise in executive search.</p>

    <div class='grid_6'>
      <h4><span class='blue'>Step 4:</span>Start making contact!</h4>
      <p>Once you've compiled a list of recruitment companies, start getting in touch. Most will have a website where you can submit your CV, but the best thing to do is to arrange an initial meeting and register your details.</p>
